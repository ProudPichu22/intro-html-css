        <h2>Sparta's Secret History Revealed?</h2>
        <p>Excavation for a community garden project on the edges of Sparta has spun in the wrong direction, finding an <strong>archaeological discovery</strong>
            that could change the history of West Michigan. A group of local volunteers working with the Historical Commission, has dug up a variety of artifacts
            that look like items from the Roman Empire.</p>
        <p>It was found over near the <strong>old Long Lake Park</strong>, with things like bronze coins, pottery, and a well-preserved marble bust.
            Analysis is still going but the experts say the artifacts appear to be real Roman treasure, coming from the first or second century.</p>
        <p>The area was closed to the public, with police officers surrounding the area. The <strong>Sparta Historical Commission</strong> has a emergency meeting
            next week to discuss the artifact and what it will do to the community.</p><br>
